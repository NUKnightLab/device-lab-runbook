# Google Home

At the time of this writing, the focus of Google Home appears working as your hands-free assistant as opposed to providing you with media content. Google Home is great for calling a taxi or turning off the lights (If you're in the lab, give it a shot by saying "Ok, Google, turn off the lights!"). If this has changed, or you know of a Google Home integration that we haven't tried, feel free to [make a pull request](https://github.com/NUKnightLab/device-lab-runbook).
