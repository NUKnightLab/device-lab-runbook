# Gear VR

The Gear VR is a mobile VR headset that can be run from an app downloaded on all our Samsung Phones. To use GearVR you actually have to plug your phone into the headset. There is a trackpad you can use for navigation on the right side of the headset. The GearVR manual is available [here](https://product-guides.oculus.com/en-us/documentation/gear-vr/latest/concepts/ug-a-us-using-gear-vr/).
