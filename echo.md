# Amazon Echo

To use the Echo, just say “Alexa…” followed by the command. In order to use the Taps, you must press the button with the microphone. The Echo and the Taps are all loaded with the same content. These devices are supposed to be smart enough to figure out that the Alexa-enabled device that’s closest to you is the one you mean, but you might have to move around a little.

#### Flash Update
Say “Alexa, give me my Flash Update” this will trigger news briefs from Quartz, Buzzfeed, The Wall Street Journal and the Daily Show

#### Wall Street Journal Custom Skill
The WSJ also has its own custom skill, to access it, try one of the following, “Alexa, ask The Wall Street Journal for a news summary”, “Alexa, ask The Wall Street Journal for the latest podcasts” or “Alexa, ask The Wall Street Journal for a market update”

#### Interactive Narratives
Say “Alexa open The Wayne Investigation” or “Alexa open The Magic Door”. These are fictional narrative experiences similar to a “Choose Your Own Adventure”

#### Adding New Skills
To try a new skill ask a Fellow to log you into the Device Lab’s Amazon account and go to [alexa.amazon.com](http://alexa.amazon.com/spa/index.html). You can search skills in the “Skills” section on the menu on the left side. Turning on a skill through this account will set up the skill on the Echo and both Taps.
