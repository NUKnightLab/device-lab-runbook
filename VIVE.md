# HTC Vive

### How to get started

1. Log into the Device Lab Desktop PC. Ask a Device Lab fellow for the password.

2. Open the Vive app on the PC.

3. Snag the Vive headset from the wall behind the PC. And the hand controllers. If you want sound as well, grab the headphones from the wall and plug them into the headset.

4. Choose an app from the Vive Library that you want to experience (some of our suggestions below). After it loads, you should be able to put the headset on and see the app running.

5. When you're done, make sure you quit the app, hang the headset and headphones up, and place the hand controllers back into the chargers.

### Our favorite apps

- **TiltBrush** // make 3D art using the hand controllers as your paintbrush
- **Rec Room** // play as a human avatar, explore a room where you can throw darts, shoot baskets, and walk around
- **Zombie Training Simulator** // attack cartoon zombies!!
