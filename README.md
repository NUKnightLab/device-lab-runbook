# Introduction

Welcome to the Runbook for the Device Lab at Northwestern University's Knight Lab!

A runbook is a compilation of procedures and routines that allow any member of a team to operate their system confidently, regardless of experience with a specific area.

We maintain a large collection of mobile, AR/VR and media production devices at the Device Lab, and our collection is growing just as quickly as the fields we're exploring are changing. Device Lab Fellows might work on an independent project that gives them deep insight into one of the areas we (say VR for instance) but not know the first thing about Voice UI. The runbook exists as a living document for us to share our knowledge as we accumulate it, so that any Fellow has a good place to start when helping any guest with any technology.

The runbook is mostly intended for internal use, but anyone interested in how we work is welcome to check it out. Think we missed something? Feel free to [make an issue](https://github.com/NUKnightLab/device-lab-runbook/issues).
