# Introduction

Welcome to the Northwestern Device Lab Official Handbook!

This Runbook is your how-to guide for all things Device Lab.

A runbook is a compilation of procedures and routines that allow any member of a team to operate their system confidently, regardless of experience with a specific area.

In the Device Lab, we have a large collection of mobile, AR/VR, and media production devices at the Device Lab, and our collection is grownig as quickly as the fields we are exploring are changing! As a result, it can be tough to keep up with all the new and emerging technologies. Here in the Device Lab, Fellows work on independent projects that give them deep insights into one of the areas we are exploring. They become an expert on that topic, and write a page in this Runbook to help those of us that might not be as experienced with their topic of choice.

Check out the pages to the left to explore how to get started on all of our emerging technologies.
