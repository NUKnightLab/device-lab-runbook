### How to set up the mic

The TetraMic has several cords and steps to set up that seem scary at first, but it is very straightforward! This section will guide you through the process with pictures. 


1. **Locate the TetraMic.** Find the port on the bottom.

4. **Attach the CAT5e/CAT6 cable.** They must be shielded for the mic to work! CAT6 cables are always shielded but CAT5e cables are sometimes not shielded. We recommend always using CAT6

### How to record with the mic

Congratulations, you have set up the TetraMic! Now you want to record. This process can also seem daunting, but the below guide should make it very simple. It is important to note that while the TetraMic does record in 360 degrees, it still has a 'front' which is important for editing purposes. This front is indicated by the etched 'Core' logo on the bronze handle of the microphone.


1. **Make sure all levels on the four dials on the front are equal.** You can adjust the gain depending on how loud your subject is, but make sure to keep all the tracks equal.

4. **Supply mic power.** Go to menu by navigating with the same black dial - scroll until you find a screen that says ‘Mic Power’ (page 7/18). Scroll through phantom power, and make sure phantom power is on for all four channels. Voltage should be at 48V for each.
