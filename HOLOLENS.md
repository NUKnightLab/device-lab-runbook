# HoloLens

### What is the HoloLens?

1. HoloLens is a new breed of holographic computer. The headset projects 3D holograms onto the lenses in your physical space. The wearer can move around the object, manipulate it, and experience it as if it were actually present. 

2. Its uses:
 - Architects/designers: 3D designing in space (try 3D drawing!)
 - Students: study anatomy models, examine the galaxy
 - For fun: AR games! (Fragments, Roboraid)
 - You could take a video call while walking around the office
 - Use IE browser. (Imagine watching YouTube videos on the wall and putting your actual FB wall on a wall!) You can do pretty much most of the things on a 2D computer with Hololens
 - Multitask.

3. It’s powered by a CPU. It also has a holographic processing unit (HPU) that knows where you're looking, interprets your gestures and spatially maps your environment. It has 64GB storage.

4. For those who are interested: Holographic apps are written in Unity and C#. Code files are written in C#, which most people edit in Visual Studio.To compile and test the apps, you have to export it from Unity into Visual Studio. 



### How to use the HoloLens

1. Press the on/off button and see the lights light up.

2. Put the headset on and wait for it to load. (It make take a while and sometimes it will show “mapping your surroundings”)

3. Wait to see all the holograms appear. 

4. Do a [“bloom” gesture](http://gph.is/2oJIUs4). Adjust the lens until you can see all 4 corners of the menu window.

5. “Bloom” again so the menu will disappear.


###For first-time users:

1. First get familiar with manipulating the Holograms.
 - Pay attention to the white dot, that’s the cursor. Watch how it follows your gaze as you look at different holograms.
 - Put your index finger in front of you and place the white dot on a hologram. The white dot becomes a white circle.
 - Do an “air tap” to click. Gif:
 - Try playing different holograms, move them around, and adjust their sizes.

### For users who have learnt the gestures:
 - Recommended programs to be found on the menu: Fragments, Roboraid, 3D Drawing, Galaxy, Anatomy
 - Try voice control for online searches. Say “Hey Cortana”
 - Try using the Internet browser.
