# Using the Podcasting Equipment

1. Log into the knightlab iMac account with the password, "knightlab"

2. After logging in, open up Garageband, which is placed in the dock towards the bottom of the screen.

3. Once Garageband opens, you’ll be faced with a menu asking what kind of project you want to make. Click on the “Voice” preset, then click “Choose”
1. NOTE: When you first load the application, Garageband may also load the last project that was being worked on from this computer. If someone else’s project loads, just press Command + N, and you’ll see the window with Project presets appear.

4. Go ahead and make sure that the mixer (the device with a bunch of knobs on it near the iMac keyboard), is plugged in and on. You should see some colored lights on the mixer if it’s on. If it’s not on, just make sure the USB connection and the power cord are all the way plugged in.

5. Head back into Garageband, and take note of the list of different tracks that Garageband has automatically added to your project (e.g. Narration Vocal, Bright Vocal, Classic Vocal, etc.). Delete all of them, and once you’ve deleted the last track, a menu will pop up asking what kind of input you do want to use. Click on the microphone, and hit “Ok”. Garageband will insert a new track, “Audio 1”

6. Go ahead and clap a few times, and verify that the audio levels on Audio 1 are, in fact, moving when you clap. You can also monitor the indicator lights on the mixer to verify this. If nothing appears, make sure that the WHITE knobs on the BOTTOM row of the mixer are all around 50% (pointing upward). This should solve all volume issues.

7. [Optional] Go ahead and test the recording by going into Garageband and clicking on the big red record button towards the top of the screen. Just record a few a seconds, and then play it back to ensure that your voice was being recorded properly.

8. Go ahead and click on the record button and begin your podcast!
