# Oculus Rift

### How to get started

1. Log into the Device Lab Laptop PC. Ask a Device Lab fellow for the password.

2. Open the Oculus Rift app on the PC.

3. Snag the Oculus headset from the wall behind the PC. 

4. Choose an app you want to experience from the Library (some of our suggestions below). After it loads, you should be able to put the headset on and see the app running. 

5. Depending on what app you choose, pick either the remote (for most apps) or the hand controllers.

6. When you're done, hang the headset back up and quit the app.

### Our favorite apps

- **Dear Angelica** // a beautiful 5-minute-long story of a girl and her mother created using Quill
- **Quill** // the equivalent of the Vive's TiltBrush. Make 3D art using the hand controllers.
- **The Climb** // an exhilirating game where you play as a rock climber and try not to fall to your death (which you inevitably will several times). Use the hand controllers.
- **Puppy Bowl** // 360 video of real puppies playing football!
