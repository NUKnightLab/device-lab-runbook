# Daydream and Cardboard

### How to get started

1. Grab a mobile device from the Mobile Device Suite. For the Daydream, you must choose the Google Pixel. The Cardboard is more flexible, but the Pixel is good for this too. Ask a Device Lab fellow for the passcode to the phones.

2. Choose a VR app on the phone to try (some of our suggestions below). For the Daydream, click the Daydream app on the Pixel. Any Cardboard app can also be used in the Daydream (it just won't involve the controller). Our devices have different VR apps loaded onto them, so browse through them all. 

3. Grab a headset. The Daydream is located behind the Device Lab PC on the wall and a Cardboard can be found on the coffee table (ask a fellow if there isn't one). If using the Daydream you'll need the controller for that (located inside the headset).

4. The apps will prompt you when to put the phone into the headset. When it does, flip it sideways and place it in. Adjust the viewers as necessary until you can see clearly. If the app includes sound, please use headphones. 

5. When you're done, make sure you quit the app and place the headsets and phones back where you found them.
